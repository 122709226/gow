ABOUT
-----
Gow is a project to provide the most useful Unix/GNU utilities on Windows with 
a convenient installer.  It's really for folks that dislike all the junk that
gets installed with Cygwin but want more than just a bunch of binaries like the 
"GNU utilities for Win32" (http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/) project includes.

It includes the following several things:

* Installs all files into a convenient directory (C:\Program Files\gow) along
  with a clean uninstaller for upgrades or removal.  
* Adds a "Command prompt here" option to the right-click menu of Windows
  Explorer that opens a cmd.exe window in that directory so you can easily
  run commands.  
* Adds Unix-like commands like whereis.
